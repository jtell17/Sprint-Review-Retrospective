How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To turn user needs into functioning software, I focus on understanding what the user wants and then break that down into specific, goal-driven tasks. These tasks—called user stories—act like a roadmap, guiding what the program should do and how it should behave. During the SNHU Travel project, for example, we used user stories to build features step by step. One story involved showing detailed information about travel packages. We didn’t do it all at once—we first handled displaying images, then added the descriptions later in a separate sprint. This made it easier to focus on getting each part right and adapt when priorities shifted.


How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When starting any programming task, I like to work in short, focused development cycles. Using Agile—especially Scrum—helps keep things organized and flexible. I’ve found that sprint planning, daily check-ins, and regular retrospectives help teams move forward in a steady and manageable way. These methods also make it easier to handle unexpected changes, which is something I value in any project. Moving forward, I want to continue using these techniques because they help maintain momentum and make it easier to deliver functional updates that match the user’s evolving needs.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me, being a strong team player in software development means being dependable, communicating clearly, and looking out for the success of the whole team—not just your part. Throughout the SNHU Travel project, we held daily stand-ups to talk through what we were working on and where we needed help. I remember one situation where a teammate was struggling to connect a slideshow to the data, and someone else offered help immediately. That kind of teamwork made a big difference. I also made an effort to keep everyone informed by sending updates and reminders when needed. Great teamwork comes from being engaged, helpful, and ready to step up when needed.
